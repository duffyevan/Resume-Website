        <h1>You've Got Mail Light</h1><small>February 2016</small>
        <p>After realizing that my phone doesn't do a great job of notifying me of new emails, I decided to create this project. Using a raspberry pi, python, and IMAP, POP, and GPIO libraries, I set up 2 lights mounted on my monitor that will light up when I get emails. The red light flashes 4 times when a new email comes in, and the yellow light stays solid until I have no unread messages in my inbox. The code is all on github ready for you to use too! Just enter your credentials in the files and it'll work just like mine</p>

        <h1>Malevolent Mansion:</h1><small>September 2015</small>
        <p>Created in a group of 4 in just 7 weeks, Malevolent Mansion is the product of WPI's IMGD 1001 (Introduction To Game Design) class, which used a game engine called Ren'Py, which expands upon Py Game. The objective of the game is to escape a mansion that the player has been trapped in while searching for a place to sleep overnight in a storm. The player must face challenges and puzzles to be able to escape the mansion without dying.</p>

        <h1>SNAKE! GameBoy Edition</h1><small>July 2015</small>
        <p>Based on a game I created in 2013 that ran on the TI-84 series calculator, SNAKE! GameBoy Edition is (obviously) a port from the TI-BASIC language of the calculator to the C language supported by Nintendo's GameBoy. SNAKE! Is a survival game in which you must navigate around dots on the screen being careful not to crash into them, or into your own tail. The game was well received by classmates at the time of its creation in 2013 and the sequel received just as much praise. The game is compatible with every GameBoy and GameBoy Color model.</p>

        <h1>Space Fish</h1><small>February 2014</small>
        <p>Space Fish is a silly, survival, side-scroller game in which the player, who is a floating fish in space with sunglasses, must destroy alien space ships with lasers without being hit by radioactive pellets hurled at them by the aliens. Unfortunately for Space Fish, the aliens will never stop coming, so he will eventually face his impending doom, but it is up to YOU to keep him alive for as long as possible. In the updated version of the initial release there are 4 game modes (easy, medium, hard, and impossible, which really is impossible, it will even lag most computers) and 2 different power-ups, one that regenerates health and another that makes Space Fish invincible for a short amount of time. <br>The game was written in Processing for java, and the older version for javascript as well, so it is able to be played in an html canvas! <br>Space Fish became the mascot of the computer science program in my hometown for some time. It was shown off at a tech conference later that year.</p>
