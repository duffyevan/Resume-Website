        <h1>You've Got Mail Light</h1><small>February 2016</small>
        <p>After realizing that my phone doesn't do a great job of notifying me of new emails, I decided to create this project. Using a raspberry pi, python, and IMAP, POP, and GPIO libraries, I set up 2 lights mounted on my monitor that will light up when I get emails. The red light flashes 4 times when a new email comes in, and the yellow light stays solid until I have no unread messages in my inbox. The code is all on github ready for you to use too! Just enter your credentials in the files and it'll work just like mine</p>

        <h1>Malevolent Mansion</h1><small>September 2015</small>
        <p>Created in a group of 4 in just 7 weeks, Malevolent Mansion is the product of WPI's IMGD 1001 (Introduction To Game Design) class, which used a game engine called Ren'Py, which expands upon Py Game. The objective of the game is to escape a mansion that the player has been trapped in while searching for a place to sleep overnight in a storm. The player must face challenges and puzzles to be able to escape the mansion without dying.</p>

       	<h1>Metioroids</h1><small>July 2014 (Yes I know its spelled wrong, I was never good at that...)</small>
       	<p>While cooped up inside because of Lyme Disease, I decided it'd be worth while to try a new programming language. Adobe ActionScript caught my attention because a friend had done some graphic design with it and I had heard it was alright for making flash style browser games. I dove in head first, having no clue what an object was, and three days later I found out that I had learned what object oriented programming was without realizing it. The outcome of the few days was a game I called Metioroids. It works very well, and ActionScript made some things very easy, but it did make some things very hard. Would I recommend ActionScript to a friend? Yeah, probably, but if you're making anything other than a flash game, it is not the right choice, and with the price-tag of Adobe Creative Suite, it is definitely not worth it. Lets just say it has it's purpose. Anyways here is the outcome of my object oriented adventure</p>

        <h1>Space Fish</h1><small>February 2014</small>
        <p>Space Fish is a silly, survival, side-scroller game in which the player, who is a floating fish in space with sunglasses, must destroy alien space ships with lasers without being hit by radioactive pellets hurled at them by the aliens. Unfortunately for Space Fish, the aliens will never stop coming, so he will eventually face his impending doom, but it is up to YOU to keep him alive for as long as possible. In the updated version of the initial release there are 4 game modes (easy, medium, hard, and impossible, which really is impossible, it will even lag most computers) and 2 different power-ups, one that regenerates health and another that makes Space Fish invincible for a short amount of time. <br>The game was written in Processing for java, and the older version for javascript as well, so it is able to be played in an html canvas! <br>Space Fish became the mascot of the computer science program in my hometown for some time. It was shown off at a tech conference later that year.</p>

        <h1>Walrus Hurdles</h1><small>April 2014</small>
        <p>The successor to Space Fish, Walrus Hurdles is another infinite side-scroller in which you are a walrus that has to jump over hurdles on a track. There is not much more to this game but it is mildly entertaining. The story behind this game dates way back, but long story short, the only thing I can draw by hand is a Walrus, and my friend thought it'd be funny to make a game where a walrus jumps over hurdles. To create the walrus from the game I drew a walrus by hand, scanned it, then colored it with the pastel colors of the game using photo-shop. Over all it was probably as hard if not harder to create than space fish, but it was much simpler, and lacked difficulty. Never the less, my classmates found it hilarious.</p>

        <h1>SNAKE! GameBoy Edition</h1><small>July 2015</small>
        <p>Based on a game I created in 2013 that ran on the TI-84 series calculator, SNAKE! GameBoy Edition is (obviously) a port from the TI-BASIC language of the calculator to the C language supported by Nintendo's GameBoy. SNAKE! Is a survival game in which you must navigate around dots on the screen being careful not to crash into them, or into your own tail. The game was well received by classmates at the time of its creation in 2013 and the sequel received just as much praise. The game is compatible with every GameBoy and GameBoy Color model.</p>

        <h1>Backgammon AI</h1><small>April 2015</small>
        <p>As a final project for AP Computer Science at Arlington High School, a friend of mine and I were assigned to create an automated backgammon player that would utilize a game written by our teacher. My friend was good at backgammon and I was good at writhing the code, so we would sit down and plan what kind of strategies we wanted to use to try to beat other AIs. In the end we created an algorithm that not only could beat all the other AIs from our classmates, it could beat us, and even our professor's AI sometimes. Unfortunately I only have the source for our algorithm that ran in the environment of our teacher's game, and I don't have the game, so I can't run it unless I find that code, but as soon as I do I will upload it!</p>
